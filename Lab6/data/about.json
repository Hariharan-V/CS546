  "biography": "I was born in India, in a small harbor town named Tuticorin. It is also where my mom and her parents were born. It is common in India for the mother to have her first child be born in her home town. Being a healthy, and chubby, I was likened to the baby boy who appears on Indian commercials selling biscuits. \nI grew up in various parts of India, and around the time I was eleven years old, my dad got an opportunity to work in the U.S. Seeing how it could be a very good opportunity for me to get an education here, he took me and my mom along with him as well. Getting acclimated to such a diverse country was hard, but after 9 years, I can proudly call myself American .",
