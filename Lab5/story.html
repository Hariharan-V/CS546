<h1>That Time I Broke My Arm</h1>
<main>
  <h2>Preface</h2>
  <p>I'd like to preface this story by noting the fact that I am in no way athletic. My body wasn't built for it.I knew that then and I still do now. But I like to have fun, and part of that is getting involved in sports, regardless of how bad I am.</p>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Once upon a time, back in sophomore year of high school, I was due for a rec basketball game. It was overall a bad week, since I had midterms, projects, and essays all due over the period of three or four days. As if that wasn't bad enough, my mother, who's super-superstitious warned me multiple times that my horoscope says I need to stay safe, as I have a possibility of getting into an accident. I am not superstitious, okay I am a little-stitious (shoutout to Micheal Scott), I took extra precautions during practice to play safe for the game. I even bought myself a pair of boots to make sure I don't slip on ice.</p>
  <h2>Climax</h2>
  <p>The day of the game, I had two midterms for subjects I absolutely hated, AP US History and AP Chemistry. I completely bombed US History, even though I stayed up all nigth studying for it. The lack of sleep had me be delusional, and since high school cafeterias rarely sell coffee, I had no way to regain some sanity. School ended, and I quickly changed to play the game. My head just wasn't in it. But surprisingly, I was doing pretty well. I got cocky. I forgot my mother's warning. I went up for a layup, and I got tripped by another kid who was trying to block my shot. I was about half a foot above the ground, while my body tilted, making it fall upside down. To protect head, I put my right arm up. I quickly black out for a second, and I realize something is wrong. Everyone's looking at me with disgust. I try getting up and my right arm isn't following. I look down and i realize my arm is bent the wrong way, like Harry's arm  when he participates in quidditch for the second time. </p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Thankfully, the surgery to fix my arm went well, but I had to take a few days off since my arm was just killing me. The doctor had given me a bottle of Oxys, which my mom just threw away since they can be quite addictive. But not only was I in pain, I wasn't allowed to take any pain meds. And the worst part? No prescriptions were given, so I can't even go buy anything in a pharmacy. A few valuable lessons were learnt that day though: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>However unscientific a mothers instincts are, you just don't question it.</li>
      <li>Never get cocky, not even when you're just playing a rec basketball game</li>
      <li>Always ask for a copy of the prescription, you know, in case your mother throws your medicine away</li>
    </ol>
